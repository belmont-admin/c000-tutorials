# Interactive Name Badge

## Introduction @unplugged

Make yourself known with a fancy name badge powered by your @boardname@!

We will use this project to learn the key steps in wrting code to run on the @boardname@. You will:

1. **Code it**     - write your code in the MakeCode editor
2. **Test it**     - use the simulator to debug your code
3. **Connect it**  - attach your micro:bit to the PC with a USB cable
4. **Pair it**     - set up the communication link to the micro:bit  
5. **Download it** - send your code to the micro:bit
6. **Use it**      - check your code running on the micro:bit
7. **Save it**     - save your code to your student drive

## Step 1: Code @fullscreen

First, let's get your name to display on the screen.

From the ``||input:Input||`` Toolbox drawer, drag an ``||input:on button A pressed||`` block onto the Workspace.

```blocks
input.onButtonPressed(Button.A, function () {

})
```

## Step 2: Show a string @fullscreen

From the ``||basic:Basic||`` Toolbox drawer drag a ``||basic:show string||`` block into the ``||input:on button A pressed||`` block.

```blocks
input.onButtonPressed(Button.A, function () {
    basic.showString("Hello!")
})
```

## Step 3: Show my name @fullscreen

In the ``||basic:show string||`` block, type your name.

```blocks
input.onButtonPressed(Button.A, function () {
    basic.showString("My Name")
})
```

## Step 4: Test the badge @fullscreen

Go to the simulator and test your name badge by pressing button **A**.

## Step 5: Download @fullscreen

Congratulations on writing your first bit of code for the micro:bit. 

Now you need **download** your code onto the micro:bit and run it. You should have already loaded a page of instructions on how to do that from the Belmont Primary Code Club web site.

To follow the Download instructions you will need to click the `|Finish|` button to end this tutorial.

Once you have downloaded your code remember to **save** it as well.
